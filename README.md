This repository contains various projects completed during my M.S. in Applied Statistics at KSU.

## ecommerce
__Language: R__

Analysis of the effects of customer reviews (rating and reviews volume), brand, and other factors on sales rank.  Insights into product performance and perception distilled from customer review text.  Techniques employed include:
  * Scraping of HTML source code
  * Text mining
  * Linear regression techniques
  * Loglinear regression to test for associations in categorical variables
  
## math-educ
__Language: SAS__

Analysis of the potential effect of self-control on the development of mathematical ability over time in Hispanic children (in early childhood education).  Techniques employed include:
  * Longitudinal analysis
  * Logistic regression

## pop-growth
__Language: R__

Modeling of population growth by county in the United States between 2000 and 2010 using US Census data.  Techniques employed include:
  * DUPLEX algorithm for splitting data into training and test data sets
  * Ordinary least squares (OLS) and robust regression
  * Data visualization using choropleths

## visualize-big-data
__Language: R__

Feature reduction of high dimensional data to only 3 dimensions (such that it can be readily visualized) using multiple techniques: 
  * Principal components analysis (PCA)
  * Kernel principal components analysis (KPCA)
  * Kernel entropy components analysis (KECA)
  
The goal, in addition to dimension reduction, was to maximize "visualizability in 3D", a metric comparing the structural grouping of the data before and after reduction.
