# MSAS Work
This repository contains various projects completed during my M.S. in Applied Statistics at KSU.

## pop-growth
Modeling of population growth by county in the United States between 2000 and 2010 using US Census data.  Techniques employed include:
  * DUPLEX algorithm for splitting data into training and test data sets
  * Ordinary least squares (OLS) and robust regression
  * Data visualization using choropleths

## visualize-big-data
Feature reduction of high dimensional data to only 3 dimensions (such that it can be readily visualized) using multiple techniques: 
  * Principal components analysis (PCA)
  * Kernel principal components analysis (KPCA)
  * Kernel entropy components analysis (KECA)
  
 The goal, in addition to dimension reduction, was to maximize "visualizability in 3D", a metric comparing the structural grouping of the 
 data before and after reduction.
