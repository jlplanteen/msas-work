# The Effect of Self-Control on the Development of Mathematical Ability over Time

__Language: SAS__

Development of model for mathematical ability in Hispanic children using gender, self-control, and time (five data collection waves during 
elementary school) to understand the potential impact of self-control on math skills development.  Techniques used included:
  -  Longitudinal analysis (generalized linear model with unstructured covariance matrix)
  -  Logistic regression (for missing data analysis)

##Abstract
Development of mathematical ability in early childhood education is crucial for producing students with high technical competencies for 
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.  Hispanic children in particular have been found to have lower 
mathematical proficiency in the early grades; additionally, a studentâ€™s self control has been previously linked with their academic 
achievement.  This study took previous research a step further to determine how self control affected the development of mathematical 
ability over time.  Mathematical ability and self control were assessed for 3,761 Hispanic students at five different times between fall 
of Kindergarten and spring of 5th grade.  A generalized linear model with an unstructured covariance matrix was used to create a 
parsimonious model linking math performance to time, age at entry to Kindergarten, gender, and self control.

It was ultimately found that higher self control levels did predict higher mathematical performance as well as a higher rate of increase 
in mathematical ability over time for Hispanic students.  Additionally, Kindergarten entry age, while not the primary predictor of 
interest, was found to have a large impact on mathematical ability which persisted over the course of this study.  Finally, perhaps most 
importantly, it was found that a small subset of students had uncharacteristically high mathematical ability at the fall of Kindergarten.  Better understanding the reasons behind this initial success might prove to be the most beneficial area for future research.  The results 
from this study may help educators develop more inclusive and effective educational strategies; strategies specifically geared towards 
those students with lower self-control may help lessen the gap in mathematical ability.
